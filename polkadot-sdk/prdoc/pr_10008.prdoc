title: Add instant seal to omni-node
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Adds a new `--instant-seal` CLI flag to enable instant seal mode in omni-node. When this flag
    is passed, blocks are produced immediately upon receiving transactions, rather than at fixed
    intervals. This flag cannot be used together with `--dev-block-time`.
